## aion-loot-counter
Loot counter for group instance specifically designed for Sauro Supply Base (Aion 4.6) but can be useful too for other instances.

**How to use:**
1. Download the **AionLootCounter.exe** in the repository
2. Open the app
3. Put the character names in **Name** fields
4. Watch out for the loots in-game that needs to be counted and record it in the app by adjusting the Bag, Yellow or Eternal value
5. Click the **Copy Text** button to copy the loots records and paste it in-game chat to share it to your group

**Notes:**
- This loot counter does not read chat log, you have to manually count the loots in app.
- If you were less than 6 people in the group, just leave the other row empty.
- The Mythic is not included in the copied text.

I'm already developing a version 2 for this on my free time, it's more better, I'll publish it soon here.
